# Getting started with VMWare

[VMWare vSphere](https://www.vmware.com/nl/products/vsphere.html) is a server virtualisation platform that aggregates compute resources and allows virtual machines to be created from them.

Setting up VMWare vSphere is outside the scope of this guide. Once a target environment has been set up, follow the instructions for [creating PNDA on VMWare](OVERVIEW.md).
